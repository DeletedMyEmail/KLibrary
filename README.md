## About The Project

This is just a small collection of classes that will help you deal with <br> 
- [SQLite](src/KLibrary/Utils/SQLUtils.java), 
- [arrays](src/KLibrary/Utils/ArrayUtils.java), 
- [encryption](src/KLibrary/Utils/EncryptionUtils.java) (OTP, RSA, Hashing),
- [sockets](src/KLibrary/Utils/ServerSocketManager.java),
- [classes of the North Rhine-Westphalia government](src/KLibrary/Utils/AbiturKlassenUtils/) (List)

## Getting Started

Add the [JAR](out/artifacts/KLibrary_jar) to your project as shown [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1051640/correct-way-to-add-external-jars-lib-jar-to-an-intellij-idea-project). That's it. Now you're able to import all classes.
